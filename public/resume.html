    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <hr />
    <div>
        I am a web developer with a passion for creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. With
        expertise in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, I design and build responsive interfaces that provide an
        intuitive user experience. I enjoy the challenge of turning complex ideas into seamless, functional websites and
        applications that are aesthetically pleasing and efficient. Throughout my career, I have collaborated with UX
        designers, backend developers, and other team members to deliver cohesive, well-integrated solutions. My
        experience spans all stages of development, from initial design and coding to troubleshooting and maintaining
        applications. I am committed to writing clean, maintainable code and thrive in environments that prioritize
        teamwork, communication, and continuous improvement. My education in Computer Science and Information Technology
        has given me a strong technical foundation, and I am always eager to learn and grow within the fast-evolving
        tech industry.
